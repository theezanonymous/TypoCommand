# TypoCommand

A Java graphics game inspired by classic typing-defense games.  
Letters fall from the top of the screen, and the player must type them before they reach the cities below.
Difficulty increases with score (currently includes fast, vanishing, warping, and changing letters). 
Built using **Java AWT/Swing**.

## How to Run

From the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p out
javac -d out src/*.java
java -cp out src.TypoCommand
```
If the display is bugged, drag and resize the window.
