# TypoCommand

A Java graphics game inspired by classic typing-defense games.  
Letters fall from the top of the screen, and the player must type them before they reach the cities below.

Built using **Java AWT/Swing**.

## How to Run

From the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p out
javac -d out src/*.java
java -cp out src.TypoCommand

If the display is bugged, resize the window.
